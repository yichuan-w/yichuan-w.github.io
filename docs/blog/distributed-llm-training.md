# Distributed Training Systems for LLMs

## Introduction

Training Large Language Models (LLMs) requires sophisticated distributed systems. This post analyzes different approaches and architectures for distributed LLM training.

## Training Paradigms

### Data Parallelism
- Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO)
- Pipeline parallelism
- Tensor parallelism

### Key Systems

1. **Megatron-LM**
   - Model parallelism strategies
   - Memory optimization techniques
   - Scaling characteristics

2. **DeepSpeed**
   - ZeRO optimization stages
   - Communication efficiency
   - Memory management

## System Optimizations

1. Communication Patterns
   - All-reduce optimization
   - Gradient accumulation
   - Bandwidth utilization

2. Memory Management
   - Activation checkpointing
   - Gradient offloading
   - CPU-GPU hybrid approaches

## Future Trends

1. Hardware-specific optimizations
2. Automated parallelism strategies
3. Dynamic scaling techniques
