# Building High-Performance ML Systems

## Introduction

These are my collected insights and lessons learned from building and researching ML systems, particularly focusing on performance optimization and scalability.

## Key Principles

### 1. System Design

- Separation of concerns
- Resource management
- Failure handling
- Monitoring and observability

### 2. Performance Optimization

- Memory hierarchy awareness
- Computation-communication overlap
- Workload characterization
- Resource utilization

## Common Patterns

1. **Data Movement**
   - Caching strategies
   - Prefetching
   - Data layout optimization

2. **Computation**
   - Operator fusion
   - Kernel optimization
   - Hardware acceleration

## Lessons Learned

1. Profile before optimizing
2. Consider end-to-end performance
3. Design for debuggability

## Future Directions

1. AutoML for systems
2. Hardware-software co-design
3. Adaptive optimization
