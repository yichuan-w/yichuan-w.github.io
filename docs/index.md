# Yichuan Wang 

## Bio ![微信图片_20230814214647](https://github.com/yichuan520030910320/yichuan520030910320.github.io/assets/73766326/9129f24b-aa5e-4674-a918-4b2160887792){align=right style="width:7.5em; margin-left: 0.5em; margin-top: 0.5em; border-radius: 1em;"}

I am a first PhD student at UC Berkeley in [SkyLab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/) and received my B.E. in Computer Science and Technology from ACM Honored Class, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am interested in **machine learning systems and high-performance computing systems** (to be more detailed maybe distributed systems for large ML model training, and develop tailored abstractions for unique ML computational patterns to achieve higher performance).

Previously, I collaborated with **Prof.[Jinyang Li](http://www.news.cs.nyu.edu/~jinyang/)** in NYU and **Dr.[Minjie Wang](https://jermainewang.github.io/)** on a project related to scaling up GNN training. In SJTU, I am supervised by **Prof. [Quan Chen](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~chen-quan/)** at EPCC. 

I like to communicate with different people, so you can feel free to contact me via email wechat:15858459091 or yichuanwang0324 or [twitter](https://twitter.com/YichuanM)
If you are willing to know more details, you can see my [CV](https://docdro.id/AOZx9dN) here. If you are interested in my motivation, you can also look at my [SoP](https://docdro.id/OvdjJ6Q) for application.

## Selected Projects
**[:fontawesome-brands-github: RayTracer](https://github.com/yichuan520030910320/raytracer)[![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/yichuan520030910320/raytracer.svg?style=social)](https://github.com/yichuan520030910320/raytracer/stargazers)**


A system that can build its own scene and track the refraction and reflection of light in it. Several compilation-related optimizations were undertaken to enhance the overall performance.

**[:fontawesome-brands-github: Compiler for Mx* Language](https://github.com/yichuan520030910320/compiler_2021)**

Using the technology of ANTLR, semantic checking, code generation, and optimization to develop a compiler that compiles C-and-Java-like language to RV32I Assembly from scratch.

**[:fontawesome-brands-github: RISC-V CPU Implemented in Verilog RTL](https://github.com/yichuan520030910320/CPU_ACM_2021)**

Designed a RISC-V CPU with Write Buffer, ICache, DCache, and Branch Prediction. Supports RV32I instruction set (2.1-2.6 in RISC-V User Manual). Used Vivado to generate bitstream and program the Basys3 FPGA board.

**[:fontawesome-brands-github: Ticket System ](https://github.com/yichuan520030910320/My_train)**

Designed a train ticket system with multi-user support and privilege management. I implemented the backend and built a Bplustree storage. All used C++ STL data structures are from scratch (including map, and queue).
