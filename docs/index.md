## Bio ![微信图片_20230814214647](https://github.com/yichuan520030910320/yichuan520030910320.github.io/assets/73766326/9129f24b-aa5e-4674-a918-4b2160887792){align=right style="width:7.5em; margin-left: 0.5em; margin-top: 0.5em; border-radius: 1em;"}

I am a last year undergraduate student in the **ACM honor class of Shanghai Jiaotong University**, majoring in computer science and technology. I am interested in machine learning systems and high-performance computing (to be more detailed maybe distributed systems for large model training, and memory optimization solutions for AI model training).

**! Earnestly looking for Ph.D. position in 2024 Fall!**

Currently, I am also working with **Prof.[Jinyang Li](http://www.news.cs.nyu.edu/~jinyang/)** in NYU on a project related with large scale GNN training 
I will be in NYC for the second half of 2023.

In SJTU, I am supervised by **Prof. [Quan Chen](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~chen-quan/)** at EPCC. 

The most recent work is to complete the construction and optimization of a dynamic neural network reasoning framework with EPCC Lab and Microsoft Research Asia. 
The paper is accepted by **OSDI23** now.

## Selected Projects
**[:fontawesome-brands-github: RayTracer](https://github.com/yichuan520030910320/raytracer)[![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/yichuan520030910320/raytracer.svg?style=social)](https://github.com/yichuan520030910320/raytracer/stargazers)**


A system that can build its own scene and track the refraction and reflection of light in it. Several compilation-related optimizations were undertaken to enhance the overall performance.

**[:fontawesome-brands-github: Compiler for Mx* Language]([https://github.com/yichuan520030910320/raytracer](https://github.com/yichuan520030910320/compiler_2021))**

Using the technology of ANTLR, semantic checking, code generation and optimization to develop a compiler that compiles C-and-Java like language to RV32I Assembly from scratch.

**[:fontawesome-brands-github: RISC-V CPU Implemented in Verilog RTL](https://github.com/yichuan520030910320/CPU_ACM_2021)**

Designed a RISC-V CPU with Write Buffer, ICache, DCache, and Branch Prediction. Supports RV32I instruction set (2.1-2.6 in RISC-V user Manual). Used Vivado to generate bitstream and program the Basys3 FPGA board.

**[:fontawesome-brands-github: Ticket System ]([https://github.com/yichuan520030910320/raytracer](https://github.com/yichuan520030910320/My_train))**

Designed a train ticket system with multi-user support and privilege management. I implemented the backend and built a Bplustree storage. All used C++ STL data structures are from scratch (including map, queue).
