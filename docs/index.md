# Yichuan Wang 

## Bio ![profile](https://github.com/yichuan-w/yichuan-w.github.io/assets/73766326/9129f24b-aa5e-4674-a918-4b2160887792){align=right style="width:7.5em; margin-left: 0.5em; margin-top: 0.5em; border-radius: 1em;"}

I am a second-year PhD student fortunate to be advised by **[Joseph E. Gonzalez](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/)** and **[Matei Zaharia](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~matei/)** at **UC Berkeley** in **[SkyLab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/)**. I also collaborate closely with **[Sewon Min](https://www.sewonmin.com/)**. I received my B.E. in Computer Science and Technology from the **ACM Honored Class** at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (**SJTU**). My research focuses on **machine learning systems**, particularly systems for LLM training and serving, and developing tailored abstractions for unique ML computational patterns to achieve better performance. Currently, I am most interested in LLM traning/
serving/scheduling, agent systems, vector search, retrieval, large-scale RAG, and personalized AI application. If you share similar research interests, I'd love to connect and chat!

During my undergraduate studies, I collaborated with **Prof. [Jinyang Li](http://www.news.cs.nyu.edu/~jinyang/)** at NYU and **Dr. [Minjie Wang](https://jermainewang.github.io/)** on projects related to scaling up GNN training. At SJTU, I was supervised by **Prof. [Quan Chen](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~chen-quan/)** at SJTU. 

I enjoy connecting with researchers and practitioners in the field. Feel free to reach out via email, WeChat (15858459091), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YichuanM). For more details about my background, you can view my [CV](asset/CV/YichuanCV.pdf) and [Statement of Purpose](https://docdro.id/OvdjJ6Q) from my graduate school applications.

In my spare time, I contribute to open-source projects like [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang).
More recently, I have dedicated significant time to maintaining [LEANN](https://github.com/yichuan-w/LEANN) ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/yichuan-w/LEANN?style=social), evolving it from a research prototype into an open-source community project with over 20 active contributors and 40k+ downloads.

## News
[12/12/2025] Happy to release [DS SERVE](https://berkeley-large-rag.github.io/RAG-DS-Serve/), a framework for efficient and scalable neural retrieval and the largest open vector store over pre-trained data. Check out our [live demo](http://api.ds-serve.org:30888/ui)! Fun fact: Jinjian is the first undergraduate I mentored at Berkeley—it was a wonderful collaboration!

[08/10/2025] We release [LEANN](https://github.com/yichuan-w/LEANN) ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/yichuan-w/LEANN?style=social), a fully local RAG with 97% storage savings. One of the first open-source engines to bring semantic search to Claude Code, all with zero cloud cost and full privacy. Drop me an email if you’d like to contribute — we’re on a mission to build an engine that understands every piece of data on your PC.

[06/20/2025] I will attend SIGMOD in Berlin this year. Let's chat about vector database, RAG, LLM and we can hang around!

[08/29/2024] After being rejected once, DiskGNN has finally been accepted by SIGMOD25. See you in Berlin! ​:smile:


[08/13/2024] Starting my PhD journey at SkyLab—excited. :party_popper:

[05/08/2024] We put DiskGNN on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05231) If you want to train a super-large-scale GNN while balancing speed and accuracy, you should try it! We will integrate it into DGL asap. :fire:

## Misc/Hobbies

I like playing basketball! (But unfortunately, it seems that there aren't any good basketball courts near Berkeley.) So now, I might (or rather, I can only) play more badminton(I still enjoy). Besides that, I've been an NBA fan for 15 years, and I like Chris Paul! In recent years, I've also become very interested in the Premier League(I love Manchester City, come on Blue Moon!). If you share the same interests, we should chat/hang out!
